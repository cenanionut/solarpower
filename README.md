# Intelligent Solar Panel System

This repository contains the codebase for the **Intelligent Solar Panel System**, developed as part of a Bachelor's Thesis. The project aims to optimize solar energy collection through intelligent tracking and monitoring mechanisms.

## Project Overview

The Intelligent Solar Panel System is designed to enhance the efficiency of solar panels by implementing smart tracking algorithms that adjust the panel's position based on the sun's trajectory. Additionally, the system monitors various environmental parameters to ensure optimal performance.

## Features

- **Sun Tracking**: Dynamically adjusts the solar panel's orientation to maximize sunlight exposure.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Collects data on temperature, light intensity, and other relevant metrics.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides real-time graphs and analytics of the system's performance.
